I love how you approach me
Fresh white, with your pants, hanging grown man low
Everythin' you sayin' soundin' good to me
Don't need me to convince me anymore
Swagger, it's right, one blade is tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby, you doin' somethin' right
You just cancelled every other man here
You say you love my bag, and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
